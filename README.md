Mappen
======

An intuitive app for locating events near you in both time and space. You can see how it works at https://mappen.azurewebsites.net.

The app is divided up into application, data, domain, and infrastructure layers. 

If you want to check out the front end, and how the sliders and map come together to display events, click through to Application/Mappen/Scripts.

If you want to see the logic behind serving up events and tiling, checkout Domain/Tiles or Domain/Events.

Have fun!
